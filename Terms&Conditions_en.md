iNC-Mill Terms & Conditions
Effective date: Nov 23, 2025

iNC-Mill (“the App”) is a local, offline NC/G-code editor, preview, and toolpath viewer. By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please stop using the App.

1. License and Scope

The App is provided on an “as-is” basis. We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for personal, lawful use on your own devices.

You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, redistribute, or commercially resell the App without written permission.

2. Subscription and Trial

The App uses auto-renewable subscriptions with Monthly and Yearly plans only. No other tiers or one-time purchases are offered.

Non-subscribed users receive a one-time 7-day free trial with full access. After the trial ends, subscription is required to continue using subscription-gated features.

Prices and rules shown in the App Store apply. Payment is charged to your Apple ID upon confirmation. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Managing, canceling, or refunding subscriptions is handled by Apple via iOS Settings; we cannot cancel or refund subscriptions inside the App.

3. User Files

Files you import or create (NC/G-code and related data) are your responsibility.

You must ensure your files are lawful and do not infringe others’ rights.

User files are stored locally or in locations you choose. You control backup, export, and deletion.

4. Safety Notice (Important)

Editing, preview, and toolpath viewing are for reference only and do not guarantee machine safety, process feasibility, or machining quality.

You must verify all machining parameters, offsets, tools, setups, and collision checks before running on real machines.

You are solely responsible for any damage, waste, injury, or loss arising from your files or operations.

5. Intellectual Property

The App, code, UI, icons, and documentation are protected by law and owned by us or licensors. You may not use our branding without permission.

6. Disclaimer and Liability

We do not warrant that the App is error-free or uninterrupted.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

If liability is required, our total liability is limited to the amount you paid in the most recent subscription period.

7. Changes and Termination

We may update these Terms and will notify you in-app or via release notes. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or applicable laws.
